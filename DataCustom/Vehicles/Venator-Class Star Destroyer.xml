  <Description>[H3][I]Venator[i] - Class Star Destroyer[h3]
The powerful Venator-class Star Destroyers are the backbone of the Republic Navy’s carrier force. Built from the keel up as dedicated starfighter carriers, the Venators have been in service with the Republic for almost twenty years. They have served with distinction since the beginning of the Clone Wars, and carrier battle groups formed around Venators are the scourge of the CIS Navy throughout the galaxy.
[P]Related to the smaller Acclamator-class assault ships, and built in the same yard, Venators cut an imposing figure among the Republic Navy’s smaller vessels. Over a kilometre long, Venators have a broad, arrowhead-shaped hull thicker at the aft near the engines and thinner at the bow, where the hull comes to a truncated point. A towering superstructure that rises at the aft of the vessel houses two command centers, one the main bridge and the other the combat information center, where officers and crew oversee the vessel’s gunnery and fighter operations.
[P]Venators have deeply recessed port and starboard docking bays, which give the ship an angular, hourglass planform, and a long, dorsal main hangar that runs from the base of the superstructure to the tip of the bow. The hangar, protected by extra shielding and heavily armored retractable doors, is where the majority of fighters launch and recovery takes place.
[P]Heavily armed for a carrier, a Venator mounts eight twin heavy turbolaser batteries—four port and four starboard—in armored turrets that can traverse the entire length of the ship. Additionally, these vessels mount a medium turbolaser battery forward of each docking bay, heavy proton torpedo launchers, tractor beam emitters, and point defense systems.
[P]In their primary role as carriers, Venator-class ships are without peer. In their cavernous hangars they hold nearly four full wings of starfighters—more than four hundred ships—along with various shuttles and utility craft. Unlike nearly any other ship of their size, Venators can, like their smaller Acclamator-class cousins, enter a planet’s atmosphere to conduct fighter operations and to soften up landing zones with their heavy weapons. This gives these vessels unparalleled tactical and strategic flexibility, a trait very much suited to the Republic Navy’s fighting style.</Description>
