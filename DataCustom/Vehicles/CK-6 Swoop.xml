  <Description>[H3]CK-6 Swoop[h3]
Colloquially known as Freeco bikes—clone trooper shorthand for “freezing cold”—CK-6s are small, fast, one-position swoops optimized for use in sub-zero and arctic conditions. Essentially militarized JR-4 swoops, the CK-6s were ordered from Bespin Motors for cold-weather testing on Orto Plutonia, an ice planet known for its savage storms and bitter cold. They are long, thin swoops with a sealed bubble canopy enclosing the pilot and two thrusters mounted aft in port and starboard nacelles. In their short time in service with the GAR, these swoops have gained a reputation for ruggedness and reliability, and their range and agility is nearly unmatched by militarized swoops.
[P]Most operational CK-6 swoops are in service with the handful of cold-weather assault units fielded by the GAR, which use them for reconnaissance, courier service, and basic battlefield mobility..</Description>
