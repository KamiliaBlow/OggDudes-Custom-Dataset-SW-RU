The Lasan Honor Guard is an ancient order protecting the royal family. Rich in tradition, it is intertwined with the fortunes of the royal family and Lasan, and it embodies strict codes of honor and etiquette. Very few of the Honor Guard, notably Rebel Spectre-4 Garazeb “Zeb” Orrelios, survived Lasan’s destruction at the hands of the Empire.
[P]These elite fighters are experts in hand-to-hand combat, as well as ranged and melee weapons. The Honor Guard’s traditional weapon, the bo-rifle, combines all of these elements and more. The large weapon transforms into several different modes and can be collapsed to a length of a little more than a meter for easier carrying. It is most commonly extended in a double-ended electro-staff mode or deployed as a blaster rifle. Much like a sword in other cultures, the bo-rifle is highly symbolic. It is an honor to wield, and Guards are offended when unworthy individuals use the weapon. The bo-rifle even has a little-known ancient configuration used in mystical Lasan Ashla rituals. This sometimes produces incredible results, such as making a starship pilot itself through hyperspace. A defeated Guard, though, may give their bo-rifle to an enemy who has bested them.
[P]The surviving Lasat are fugitives from the Empire’s wrath, and encountering even one member of the Lasan Honor Guard is an extreme rarity. Most have likely moved to the fringes of society and the galaxy. A few may be searching for the mythical Lasat homeworld of Lira San.
[P]Members of the Honor Guard are very dangerous. Capable of destroying entire squads of troops, they are unafraid of picking up individual enemies and hurling them toward other targets. While it is possible for a member to work for anyone needing muscle, their code of honor typically deters them from working for violent criminals and other noxious forces.</Description>
